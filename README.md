# Video-Game-Recommendation-Engine


## Objective
* Gather the data using Giant Bomb API.
* Complete exploratory data analysis.
* Analyze recommendation methods.
* Deploy Application

## Background Information
* With the number of products increasing exponentially, it burdens the consumer in which products to purchase. A novel solution is the use of recommender systems (engines) to "recommend" relevant products to the consumers based on their preferences. Applications of recommender systems include areas such as playlist generators for video and music services like Netflix, YouTube, and Spotify. Additionally, product recommendations for services such as Amazon. In this project, we'll explore novel techniques in recommending video games using the Giant Bomb video game database. 

## Process:
* Preprocessing (NLP packages)
* Exploratory Data Analysis conducted utilizing various python packages (Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas, and Plotly).'
* Recommendation Methods.
    * TF-IDF
        * Cosine Similarity
        * Cosine Similarity + Singular Value Decomposition
        * K-Nearest Neighbors
        * K-Nearest Neighbors + Singular Value Decomposition
* PostgreSQL database.
